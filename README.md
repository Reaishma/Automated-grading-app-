## 🏗 Architecture

### Data Models
- **Student**: Manages student information (name, email, unique ID)
- **Assignment**: Handles assignment details (title, description, max score, due date)
- **Submission**: Tracks student submissions with content and grading results

### Core Components
- **GradingEngine**: ML-powered singleton for automated grading
- **GradingDataManager**: ObservableObject managing app state and data operations

### Grading Algorithm

![Grading system](https://github.com/Reaishma/Automated-grading-app-/blob/main/Screenshot_20250904-113855_1.jpg)

The grading engine analyzes submissions based on:
- **Content Length**: Evaluates submission thoroughness (30% weight)
- **Keyword Density**: Checks for relevant technical terms (40% weight)
- **Grammar Analysis**: Assesses sentence structure and clarity (30% weight)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Swift/SwiftUI Version
**Prerequisites:**
- Xcode 14.0 or later
- iOS 15.0+ deployment target
- macOS 12.0+ for development

**Installation:**
1. Open main.swift in Xcode
2. Build and run on iOS Simulator or device

### Kotlin Version  
**Prerequisites:**
- JDK 8 or later
- Kotlin compiler

**Running:**
```bash
# Compile and run
kotlinc GradingApp.kt -include-runtime -d GradingApp.jar
java -jar GradingApp.jar

# Or run directly
kotlin kotlin/GradingApp.kt
```

### Flutter Version
**Prerequisites:**
- Flutter SDK 3.0+
- Dart SDK 2.17+

**Installation:**
```bash
cd flutter
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Running in Replit
```bash
# Swift (command-line testing)
swift main.swift

# Kotlin
cd kotlin && kotlin GradingApp.kt

# Flutter (web version)
cd flutter && flutter run -d web-server --web-port=5000 --web-hostname=0.0.0.0
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
swift test
```

The test suite includes:
- Model creation and validation tests
- Data manager functionality tests
- Grading engine algorithm tests
- Performance benchmarking tests

### UI Tests
- Navigation flow testing
- User interaction validation
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance measurement

### Test Coverage
- **Student Management**: Creation, addition, validation
- **Assignment Handling**: CRUD operations, validation
- **Submission Processing**: Content analysis, grading workflow
- **Grading Engine**: Scoring algorithms, feedback generation
- **UI Components**: Tab navigation, button interactions, data display

## 📊 Sample Data

The app includes pre-loaded sample data:
- **3 Students**: Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, Carol Davis
- **1 Assignment**: Algorithm Analysis (100 points)
- **2 Submissions**: Varying quality for testing grading accuracy

## 🔧 Configuration

### Grading Parameters
Modify grading weights in `GradingEngine.swift`:
```swift
let lengthScore = min(Double(contentLength) / 500.0, 1.0) * 0.3
let keywordScore = min(Double(keywordCount) / 10.0, 1.0) * 0.4  
let grammarScoreNormalized = grammarScore * 0.3
```

### Keywords for Analysis
Update the keyword list for subject-specific grading:
```swift
let keywords = ["algorithm", "function", "variable", "loop", "condition", "array", "object", "class", "method", "return"]
```

## 📱 Usage
